\frametitle{Dirty Data}

Notice that throughout Topic1 we have deliberately showcased raw data with the missing values coded as '-9'. This is called 'dirty data' and is how real data exists.

Dealing with 'dirty data' is outside the scope of MATH1005, as it can require some sophistication. Ideally, we would replace all the missing values by a blank. However, one possible strategy is to account for the missing values in your histogram: create the bins (-10,0), [0,18] ..., so there is effectively 1 nonsense bin (although it still affects the calculation of frequencies of the other bins.)
